# Machine-Learning-Foundations
A structured collection of Machine Learning implementations covering core supervised learning algorithms, including mathematical foundations, from-scratch implementations, and applied model comparisons. This repository documents my journey in understanding ML concepts deeply through theory, coding, and experimentation.
